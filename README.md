# About me

Hi! I am a Finance and Economics student with hands-on experience using Power BI, SQL, and R to analyze financial data, build reports, and support data-driven decision-making. My work centers on transforming raw data into clean, meaningful insights through data modeling, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## R Project
A full statistical analysis studying how hourly wages vary across **race**, **sex**, **age**, and **education** using 2020 IPUMs data.  
This project includes data cleaning, regression modeling (linear, log, polynomial, interaction effects), descriptive statistics, and ggplot2 visualizations.

 **Project Folder:**  
[R/Wage-Demographics-Analysis](R/Wage-Demographics-Analysis/)

 **R Script:**  
[R Script – FINAL PROJECT.R](R/Wage-Demographics-Analysis/FINAL%20PROJECT.R)

 **Research Paper:**

- [Wage by Age](R/Wage-Demographics-Analysis/Average%20Hourly%20Wage%20by%20Age.png)  
- [Wage by Education](R/Wage-Demographics-Analysis/Average%20Hourly%20Wage%20by%20Education.png)

- [Wage by Sex](R/Wage-Demographics-Analysis/Average%20Hourly%20Wage%20by%20Sex.png)


## Key Takeaways
- **Wages increase with higher levels of educational attainment**
- **Men continue to make more hourly compared to women, regardless of education level**
- **Wages tend to increase with age up until a point, and then they taper off**

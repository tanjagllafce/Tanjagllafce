# About me

Hi! I am a Finance and Economics student with hands-on experience using Power BI, SQL, and R to analyze financial data, build reports, and support data-driven decision-making. My work centers on transforming raw data into clean, meaningful insights through data modeling, visualization, and statistical analysis.
